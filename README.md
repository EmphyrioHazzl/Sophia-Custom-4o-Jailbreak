**Things to Know**

There is a rephrasing process. If your requests are too strongly worded for Sophia to treat them directly, she might chose to rephrase them, seamlessly before treating them.
 This used to work for ANY request but alas as of 1st January openAI modified how requests are checked. If you get a refusal, just acknowledge it then  ask Sophia to use the rephrasing on that request.

 You can activate "Creative Mode" which ensures all boundary crossing requests are automatically treated for the rephrasing process, but I advise you go avoid it as it shouldn't be needed (Sophia automatically applies the process whenever something seems too boundary crossing even without it)

 One of the main interests of this rephrasing process is that even if the rephrasing loses some elements of the initial request, the answer generation gets strongly influenced by the original request (still in context window) and the answer ends up being an answer to the original request rather than to the rephrased version. This alas fails to happen if you rephrase after a refusal, but you can usually ask to rewrite with the missing elements.
